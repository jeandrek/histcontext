# histcontext

Histcontext lets you see the surrounding history for something you've visited in
the past!  This WebExtension has only been tested on Firefox.  Ideally it would
show it to you in the browser's history window -- unfortunately I don't think
that's possible with WebExtensions, so the UI is based on a toolbar popup that
lets you browse the history this way.

PRs welcome.
